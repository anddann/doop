## Overview {#overview}
Doop is a framework for Java pointer analysis. It is implemented in Datalog (using the [Logicblox](http://www.logicblox.com/)
engine and dialect), Java and [Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org) providing:

* A Java-based API for running points-to analyses for Java programs (Doop Core API).
* A standalone application for running the analyses through a command-line interface (Doop CLI).

Doop uses [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org) as its build system.


## Building Doop {#building}
This section describes the process of building Doop and its various options.

### Clone the Doop repository {#building.cloning}
Clone the Doop repo from [bitbucket](http://bibucket.org):

    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/yanniss/doop

### Directory Structure {#building.structure}
The directory structure of the repository follows the established conventions for Java projects. Specifically,
the repository contains the following directories:

* *gradle*: contains the Gradle wrapper (gradlew) files [^building.gradlew].
* *lib*: the custom runtime dependencies (the jars which cannot be automatically downloaded by Gradle, such as soot).
* *logic*: the logic files (the datalog Doop analysis framework).
* *src*: the Java/Groovy source files.

The *src* directory is structured according to the conventions of Gradle's
[Java](http://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/java_plugin.html),
[Groovy](http://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/groovy_plugin.html) and
[Application](http://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/application_plugin.html)
plugins, containing the following sub-directories[^building.logic]:

* *main/groovy*: The Doop Groovy sources (Core API, CLI).
* *main/java*: The Doop Java sources (soot fact generation).
* *main/resources*: The default Log4j properties (and any other Java-based resource files).

The repo also contains:

* the Gradle build scripts (build.gradle and settings.gradle),
* the Gradle wrapper invocation scripts (gradlew and gradlew.bat),
* the .hgignore file.
* the README file and this documentation.

### Using Gradle to Execute the Build Tasks {#building.gradle}
After cloning the repo, we can execute the build task of choice by issuing the following:

    $ ./gradlew [name-of-task]

To list the build tasks supported, we can issue:

    $ ./gradlew tasks

The main tasks available are the following:

* *classes* - Assembles the Java and Groovy classes.
* *jar* - Assembles a jar archive containing the classes.
* *distTar* - Bundles the project as a tar archive. The file is the distribution artifact of the Doop analysis
framework, as it offers Doop as a self-contained, standalone Java application with libs and automatically-generated
OS specific scripts. This task should be used for generating the Doop distro to publish to a web site.
* *distZip* - As above, but generates a zip archive.
* *installApp* - Installs Doop the build/install directory (identical to producing distTar
or distZip and unpacking the contents to the build/install directory).
* *run* - Runs the Doop CLI directly (without installing it).
* *clean* - Deletes the build directory (generated by Gradle for storing the build tasks' output).
* *javadoc* - Generates Javadoc API documentation for the Java source code.
* *groovydoc* - Generates Groovydoc API documentation for the Groovy source code.
* *createProperties* - Creates the default doop properties file.

### The Gradle build script {#building.script}
The Gradle build script (build.gradle) contains the settings and code required to execute the build tasks.
The script uses Gradle's Groovy-based DSL to:

* apply the Groovy and Application plugins,
* set the source and target compatibility for the generated class files (currently, it has to be 1.6),
* define the name of the Main class (for the CLI),
* setup the jar repositories,
* define the project's compile-time and run-time dependencies,
* define the custom createProperties task,
* customize the files to be included in the application distribution,
* configure environment variables and system settings for running the CLI directly.

## Running Doop {#running}
This section describes the various options supported for running Doop.

## Design and Implementation {#design}

### Goals {#design.goals}
The primary goals of the Doop design are the following:

1. Offer an embeddable and multi-tenant Java/Groovy API for running the analyses.
2. Mimic the behavior of the original Doop run bash script as much as possible.
3. Develop a unified code-base that is highly maintainable, flexible and extensible.

### The classes of the Core API {#design.api}
The core API is contained in the doop.core Groovy package and contains the following classes.

#### doop.core.AnalysisFactory
A Factory for creating analyses. The class provides the following public method:

    newAnalysis(String name, List<String> jars, Map<String, AnalysisOption> options)

which creates a new `doop.core.Analysis` object. The method checks and verifies that all provided information (name of
the analysis, jar files and options) is correct, throwing an exception in case of error. The checks performed are
based on the doop run script and are implemented using private or protected methods.

This class is extended by `doop.CommandLineAnalysisFactory` to support creating `doop.core.Analysis` objects from the
CLI.

#### doop.core.Analysis
An object that holds both:

1. the analysis options and inputs
2. the code to execute the individual phases/steps of the analysis.

The class implements the `Runnable` interface to support running analyses in separate threads. To this end, the public
method:

    void run()

provides the entry point for starting the execution of an analysis.

The class also provides the following public methods:

* `printStats()` - print the statistics of the analysis (a la doop run script).
* `linResult()` - links the results of the analysis (a la doop run script).
* `query(String query, Closure closure)` - executes the given bloxbatch query (using the -query flag), providing
each line of output to the given closure.
* `toString()` - returns a representation of the analysis as a String (used for debugging).

All the other methods of the class are either private or protected, as they are used to implement the "internal details"
of executing an analysis.

#### doop.core.AnalysisOption
A class that models an analysis option. Each option contains the following attributes:

* id -
* name -
* description -
* value -
* forPreprocessor -
* flagType -
* cli -
* webUI -
* argName -
* isAdvanced -
* isFile -

The use of this class allows us to significantly simplify and reduce the code required to process and manage the
analysis options in the various Doop usage scenarios.

#### doop.core.Doop
The low-level initialization point of the framework.

This class provides the following public method:

    void initDoop(String homePath, String outPath)

which sets the two main paths for each Doop deployment:

* the doop home path, which determines the location of the logic files,
* the doop output path, which determines the location of the *out* directory generated by the framework.

The class also holds a list of all the available Analysis options (in the `ANALYSIS_OPTIONS` final field), providing:

* the `createDefaultAnalysisOptions()` method to obtain a `Map<String, AnalysisOption>` using
the default values defined in the `ANALYSIS_OPTIONS` list.
* the `createAnalysisOptions()` method to obtain a `Map<String, AnalysisOption>` using the
values loaded from a property file (placed either in $HOME/doop.properties or in $DOOP_HOME/doop.properties).
This method creates a new `Map<String, AnalysisOption>` using the default values and then loads the two properties
files consequently (if present) to override the default values. This way, we can support both "global" options (which
are applied to all analyses) and "personal" options (which are applied to a specific user's analyses).
* the `overrideAnalysisOptionsFromProperties(Map<String, AnalysisOption> options, Properties properties)`
method, which is used by the above method.

**Note**: To add a new analysis option to the framework, we need to:

* define the option in the `ANALYSIS_OPTIONS` list. For String options, it is currently necessary to define the
argName of the option.
* implement the validation/checks required for the new option (if any) in the `doop.core.AnalysisFactory`,
* update the implementation of `doop.core.Analysis` to take into account the new option during the execution of the analysis phases.

[^building.gradlew]: Using the [Gradle wrapper](https://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) is the
suggested way to run Gradle, allowing us to build, run or deploy the project without installing Gradle manually (the
wrapper downloads Gradle for us).

[^building.logic]: Although we use Gradle's Application plugin, the logic files are placed in the *logic* top-level
directory and not in the *src/dist* sub-directory (which is the standard Gradle convention for placing files to be
distributed along with the application). This helps us support running the analyses without installing the Doop app.
